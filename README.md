# CalculatorWebApp
Basic Web Application for JIS consideration.

README

This compiled app uses .Net4.5.2, ASP.NET, MVC5, and C# as well as utilizing Microsoft Visual Studio to provide an easy to workwith UI for the user and can be quickly assmebled by the developer. The app will allow the user to perform basic mathematical operations in succession, each computation must be entered using the 'Equals' button as this provides better code control for the developer but can be reworked to not require it without too much difficulty. The app will catch incorrect inputs while not causing the app to stop running but instead refuse to allow the user to give bad input.

About: This app was developed by Jonathan Wild over the course of a few hours in the interest of submitting it to the State of Michigan JIS for consideration.
